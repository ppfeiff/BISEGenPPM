Code and data for paper under review in BISE.

Relevant files:
- _validity_issues.py_: Code to reconstruct the validity issues (section 3)
- _log_generation.py_: Code to generate the logs CF1-5 and ATT1-4 used in the experiment (section 7)
- _data/experiment_logs_: Contains the _.csv_ logs used in the experiment (section 7)

Code to run the benchmark (table 7) will be added later.
